# Git Workflow Setup - Implementation Summary

## What We've Implemented

We've set up a comprehensive Git workflow system for the Authentic Reader project that enforces best practices and consistent commit conventions. The implementation includes:

### 1. Conventional Commits Enforcement

- Added `.commitlintrc.json` to enforce the Conventional Commits format
- Created `.gitmessage` commit template to guide developers in writing proper commit messages
- Configured Git to use our commit message template by default

### 2. Git Hooks via Husky

- Implemented pre-commit hooks that:
  - Skip checks for merge commits
  - Run linting on server code
  - Verify route-controller consistency
  - Exit with error if checks fail
- Added commit-msg hooks that:
  - Validate commit messages against the Conventional Commits standard
  - Reject commits with improperly formatted messages

### 3. Automation Scripts

- Created `setup-git-hooks.js` to automatically set up all Git hooks
- Added npm script `setup:git` for easy installation
- Made all hook scripts executable

### 4. Documentation

- Created `GIT-WORKFLOW.md` with comprehensive guidelines on:
  - Commit message formats and conventions
  - Branching strategy
  - Pull request processes
  - Git commands reference
  - Troubleshooting common issues
- Added a detailed "Practical Guide" section with step-by-step instructions
- Updated the main README.md to reference our Git workflow documentation

## Benefits

This Git workflow setup provides several key benefits:

1. **Consistent History**: Standardized commit messages make the repository history more readable and useful.
2. **Automated Quality Checks**: Pre-commit hooks catch issues before they're committed.
3. **Better Collaboration**: Clear conventions make it easier for team members to work together.
4. **Simplified Release Notes**: Conventional commits make it easier to generate changelogs and release notes.
5. **Reduced Errors**: Preventing import/export issues and other common problems before they're committed.

## Dependencies Added

- `@commitlint/cli`: For validating commit messages
- `@commitlint/config-conventional`: Rules for conventional commits format
- `husky`: For managing Git hooks

## Files Created/Modified

- New Files:
  - `.commitlintrc.json`: Commit message validation rules
  - `.gitmessage`: Commit message template
  - `.husky/pre-commit`: Pre-commit hook script
  - `.husky/commit-msg`: Commit message validation hook
  - `GIT-WORKFLOW.md`: Documentation on Git best practices
  - `setup-git-hooks.js`: Setup script

- Modified Files:
  - `package.json`: Added setup:git script and dependencies
  - `README.md`: Added references to Git workflow

## Next Steps

Additional steps that could be implemented in the future:

1. **Release Management**: Add tooling for semantic versioning based on commit types.
2. **Changelog Generation**: Automate changelog generation based on commit history.
3. **Branch Protection Rules**: Set up GitHub branch protection rules to enforce PR reviews.
4. **CI Integration**: Connect with CI/CD systems to run additional checks on commits.
5. **Additional Hooks**: Implement more hooks like pre-push for running tests.
