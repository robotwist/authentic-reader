# Authentic Reader AI Enhancement Plan

## Phase 1: ONNX Runtime Integration

### Goals
- Optimize performance by replacing Hugging Face Transformers with ONNX Runtime for our most-used models
- Reduce memory usage and inference latency
- Enable more efficient deployment

### Implementation Steps

1. **Setup and Dependencies**
   - Add ONNX Runtime and related packages to the NLP service
   - Configure development environment for ONNX model conversion

2. **Model Conversion**
   - Convert the Named Entity Recognition (NER) model to ONNX format
   - Convert the Zero-Shot Classification model to ONNX format
   - Validate converted models match original model outputs

3. **Integration**
   - Create ONNX runtime inference classes in the NLP service
   - Implement fallback mechanism to original models if ONNX fails
   - Update API endpoints to use the new ONNX-based inference

4. **Performance Testing**
   - Benchmark ONNX models against original HuggingFace models
   - Test with various input sizes and batch processing
   - Document performance improvements

5. **Deployment**
   - Update deployment scripts and Docker configuration
   - Implement CI/CD pipeline updates for model artifacts

### Timeline
- Setup and Dependencies: 1 day
- Model Conversion: 2 days
- Integration: 3 days 
- Performance Testing: 2 days
- Deployment: 1 day

## Phase 2: Local Llama 3 Integration

### Goals
- Deploy a local Llama 3 instance for complex analytical tasks
- Improve text generation, summarization, and content analysis capabilities
- Reduce dependency on external APIs for advanced NLP tasks
- Enable offline or self-hosted operation

### Implementation Steps

1. **Setup and Dependencies**
   - Install Ollama on the server or development environment
   - Download and configure Llama 3 model (8B or 70B version based on hardware)
   - Set up a service layer for communication with Ollama

2. **API Service Implementation**
   - Create a new LLM service for handling Llama 3 requests
   - Implement endpoints for text generation, summarization, and analysis
   - Design prompt templates for various analytical tasks
   - Add caching for frequent queries to improve performance

3. **Integration with Authentic Reader**
   - Add article summarization capabilities to content analysis
   - Implement advanced entity relationship extraction
   - Create a bias analysis feature that examines text for perspective biases
   - Build a sentiment analysis system that goes beyond basic classification

4. **User Interface**
   - Design UI components for displaying Llama 3 generated content
   - Create interactive elements for users to refine and explore analyses
   - Add visualization tools for entity relationships and sentiment

5. **Evaluation and Tuning**
   - Benchmark accuracy against professional analyses
   - Fine-tune prompts to improve output quality
   - Optimize for performance and response time
   - Implement user feedback system for continuous improvement

### Timeline
- Setup and Dependencies: 2 days
- API Service Implementation: 3 days
- Integration with Authentic Reader: 5 days
- User Interface: 3 days
- Evaluation and Tuning: 2 days

Add user preference storage (localStorage initially)
*Phase 2: Content Analysis & Quality Filters (2-3 weeks)*
Build NLP pipeline for content analysis
Implement outrage bait and doomscroll detection algorithms
Create machine learning model for personalization (content recommendation)
Add topic categorization and tagging system
Implement content similarity detection for related articles
*Phase 3: Bias Identification System (3-4 weeks)*
Build entity recognition system
Create knowledge graph of connections between entities
Implement bias scoring algorithms
Design and implement source reliability metrics
Build visualization tools for bias and reliability
*Phase 4: User Experience & Deployment (2-3 weeks)*

Deployment Options
For deploying Authentic Reader, we have several excellent options:
Vercel: Ideal for React applications, with automatic deployments from GitHub, preview deployments for PRs, and serverless functions
Netlify: Similar to Vercel with great CI/CD, serverless functions, and form handling
AWS Amplify: Full-stack solution with authentication, storage, and API capabilities
Digital Ocean App Platform: Simple deployment with reasonable pricing for growing applications
