# Security Guidelines for Authentic Reader

This document outlines security best practices for the Authentic Reader project, particularly focusing on API token management and secure development practices.

## API Token Management

### Hugging Face API Tokens

Authentic Reader uses Hugging Face's inference API for various NLP tasks. Proper management of these tokens is critical for security.

#### Token Creation & Storage

1. **Use Fine-Grained Tokens**: Always use fine-grained tokens with the minimum necessary permissions:
   - For read-only operations, use tokens with "Read" access only
   - Restrict tokens to specific models when possible
   - Enable only the "Inference" permission if that's all you need

2. **Never commit tokens**: 
   - Always store tokens in `.env` files that are excluded in `.gitignore`
   - Use placeholder values in `.env.example` files
   - Never hardcode tokens in source code

3. **Token Rotation**:
   - Rotate tokens every 90 days (recommended)
   - Immediately rotate tokens if you suspect they've been compromised
   - Keep a log of when tokens were last rotated

#### Accessing Tokens in Code

1. **Validations**:
   - Always validate token presence before making API calls
   - Provide meaningful error messages when tokens are missing
   - Handle authentication errors gracefully

2. **Environment Variables**:
   - Access tokens through environment variables
   - Never use default hardcoded tokens as fallbacks
   - Document required environment variables in README

## Git Security Practices

1. **Sensitive Data in Git History**:
   - If you accidentally commit sensitive data, consider using tools like `git-filter-repo` to remove it
   - For major leaks, rotate all affected credentials immediately
   - Consider using pre-commit hooks to prevent committing sensitive data

2. **.gitignore**:
   - Ensure `.env` and other files with secrets are in `.gitignore`
   - Review `.gitignore` regularly to ensure it covers all sensitive files
   - Consider using `.git-blame-ignore-revs` for commits that made large formatting changes

## Secure Coding Practices

1. **Error Handling**:
   - Use structured error handling to prevent exposing sensitive information
   - Log errors appropriately without exposing sensitive data
   - Provide user-friendly error messages that don't reveal internal workings

2. **Input Validation**:
   - Validate all inputs, especially those from users
   - Use proper encoding/escaping when displaying user input
   - Be cautious with dynamic code evaluation

3. **Dependency Management**:
   - Regularly update dependencies to fix known vulnerabilities
   - Use tools like `npm audit` to check for vulnerable dependencies
   - Consider using lockfiles to ensure consistent dependency versions

## Monitoring & Responding to Security Issues

1. **Logging**:
   - Implement appropriate logging for security-relevant events
   - Do not log sensitive data like tokens or passwords
   - Consider using a centralized logging system for easier monitoring

2. **Incident Response**:
   - Document steps to take when a security issue is discovered
   - Know how to rotate all credentials quickly if needed
   - Maintain contact information for security-relevant services (like Hugging Face)

3. **Regular Reviews**:
   - Conduct periodic code reviews focused on security
   - Review access control and token permissions regularly
   - Stay updated on security best practices for your tech stack
