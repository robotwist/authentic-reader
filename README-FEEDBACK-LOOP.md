# Authentic Reader: AI Feedback Loop System

This document outlines the AI Feedback Loop implementation for Authentic Reader, an intelligent RSS reader application that uses multiple AI services for article analysis.

## Overview

The AI Feedback Loop system is designed to:

1. Collect user feedback on AI-generated analysis of articles
2. Store feedback data in ChromaDB or localStorage (fallback)
3. Visualize feedback data through dashboards
4. Train improved models using collected feedback
5. Deploy improved models for better article analysis

## Architecture Components

### 1. Feedback Collection

- **FeedbackPanel Component**: A React component embedded within analysis displays that allows users to:
  - Rate the accuracy of analysis (thumbs up/down)
  - Provide star ratings (1-5)
  - Submit comments for improvement

### 2. Data Storage

- **ChromaDB Integration**: Vector database for storing feedback with metadata
  - Fallbacks to localStorage if ChromaDB is not available
  - Fast similarity search for finding related feedback
  - Supports long-term persistence of feedback data

### 3. Feedback Dashboard

- **FeedbackDashboard Component**: Administrative interface showing:
  - Overall feedback statistics
  - Feedback distribution by analysis type
  - Accuracy metrics over time
  - Raw feedback items with filtering options

### 4. Model Training

- **TrainingService**: Services for improving models based on feedback
  - Prepares training data from feedback
  - Supports multiple analysis tasks (fallacy, bias, sentiment)
  - Tracks model versioning and improvement metrics

## How It Works

1. **Analysis Generation**: When a user requests analysis of an article, AI services generate results
2. **Feedback Collection**: After reviewing the analysis, users can provide feedback
3. **Data Storage**: Feedback is stored with context (article, prediction, user input)
4. **Analytics**: Dashboards track feedback patterns and model performance
5. **Model Improvement**: Collected feedback is used to train new model versions
6. **Deployment**: Improved models are used for future analysis

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Ensure ChromaDB is installed and running (optional but recommended)
  ```
  docker run -p 8000:8000 chromadb/chroma
  ```

- Configure environment variables:
  ```
  CHROMA_HOST=localhost
  CHROMA_PORT=8000
  ENABLE_FEEDBACK_LOOP=true
  ```

### Usage

1. **Setup ChromaDB Service**:
   - The ChromaDB service automatically initializes on application start
   - It will create required collections if they don't exist

2. **Enable Feedback UI**:
   - The feedback panel appears automatically in article analysis views
   - No additional setup is needed for basic feedback collection

3. **Access the Dashboard**:
   - Navigate to `/feedback` or `/analytics` to view the feedback dashboard
   - Only authenticated users can access these routes

4. **Train Models**:
   - Use the training controls in the dashboard
   - Select the task type (fallacy, bias, etc.)
   - Click "Start Training" when sufficient feedback is available

## Implementation Details

### FeedbackPanel Component

The FeedbackPanel component is designed to be embedded within analysis results, collecting:

- Binary correctness feedback (yes/no)
- Numerical ratings (1-5 stars)
- Text comments for improvements
- Timestamp and context data

### ChromaDB Service

The ChromaDB service manages:

- Collection creation and management
- Document storage with embedding support
- Fallback mechanisms when ChromaDB is unavailable
- Querying for similar items or specific feedback

### Training Service

The TrainingService handles:

- Data preparation for different AI tasks
- Model registry management
- Training orchestration
- Performance metrics tracking

## Best Practices

1. **Regular Training**: Schedule regular model training as feedback accumulates
2. **Diverse Feedback**: Encourage feedback from users with different backgrounds
3. **Monitor Metrics**: Watch the dashboard for declining performance
4. **Version Control**: Track model versions and their performance
5. **Cost Management**: Balance training frequency with computational resources

## Future Enhancements

- **Active Learning**: Prioritize collection of feedback on uncertain predictions
- **User Segments**: Track feedback patterns by user demographics
- **Multi-model Ensemble**: Use feedback to optimize model weighting
- **A/B Testing**: Compare different model versions with controlled user groups
- **Feedback Incentives**: Reward users for providing high-quality feedback

## Troubleshooting

- **Missing Feedback**: Check localStorage if ChromaDB connection fails
- **Training Errors**: Ensure at least 10 items of feedback before training
- **Dashboard Not Loading**: Verify authentication status and permission levels
